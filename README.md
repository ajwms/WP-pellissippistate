How to use Wordpress at Pellissippi State

This is how to use our installation of Wordpress at Pellissippi State Community College.

The location of the blog platform is [http://blogs.pstcc.edu](http://blogs.pstcc.edu)

From this web page, you can log in using your current Pellissippi username and password (like you use for Webmail and online classes)

If this is the first time you log in, a blog will be created. It will be located at this URL:

http://blogs.pstcc.edu/yourusername

For example, if your name is Master Yoda and your email is myoda@pstcc.edu, then your blog would be at: http://blogs.pstcc.edu/myoda
